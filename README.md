# ecommerceDB

## Description
This project builds a back end for an e-commerce site. I configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

The user can use GET routes to access all categories, all products, and all tags. They can use GET routes to get a single category, a single product, and a single tag by referencing the id. There are additinally POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories, products, and tags.
